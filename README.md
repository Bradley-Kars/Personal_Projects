# Personal_Projects Repository: ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to showcasing my tinkering and experimentation with various personal projects under the aptly named "Personal_Projects" repository. Here, I dive into different ideas and concepts, bringing them to life through code. Currently, the repository features two distinct attempts at creating a Pokedex. Version 1 (V1) was crafted in Python, while Version 2 (V2) is a blend of HTML and CSS.

## Repository Details

- **Repository Name:** Personal_Projects

- **Number of Projects:** 2

## About Me

Hello, I'm Bradley Kars, an avid explorer of technology and coding enthusiast. As a System Support Specialist by profession, I'm constantly seeking ways to enhance my skills and contribute to the dynamic world of IT. With experience managing IT operations for a commercial construction company, I've developed a diverse skill set. Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security with a focus on Game Development, I'm thrilled to merge my coding expertise with insights into cybersecurity.

## The Projects

### Pokedex V1 (Python)
My first iteration of the Pokedex was crafted using Python. I delved into data manipulation and display, creating a simple yet functional version of this iconic digital encyclopedia for Pokemon. Using Python dictionaries, I mapped each Pokemon's name to its properties, including type, stats, and description. Users could input a Pokemon's name, and if it existed in the Pokedex, its properties were displayed.

### Pokedex V2 (HTML & CSS)
Version 2 of my Pokedex took a different route by using HTML and CSS. This project focused on web development to create an interactive and visually appealing Pokedex. A web form allowed users to select a Pokemon from a dropdown menu. Upon selection, the webpage dynamically populated with the chosen Pokemon's data, including its number, types, stats, and description. The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided an engaging user experience.

## Repository Structure

The "Personal_Projects" repository houses distinct folders for each project:

- **Pokedex V1 (Python):** This folder holds the code, resources, and documentation for the Python-based Pokedex V1 project.
- **Pokedex V2 (HTML & CSS):** Within this folder, you'll find the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, along with any relevant assets, for the HTML/CSS-based Pokedex V2 project.
