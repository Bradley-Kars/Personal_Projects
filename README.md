# Personal_Projects Repository: ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to showcasing my tinkering and experimentation with various personal projects under the aptly named "Personal_Projects" repository. Here, I dive into different ideas and concepts, bringing them to life through code. Currently, the repository features a diverse set of projects, including Pokedex V1 (Python), Pokedex V2 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Prime Number Generator (Python), Loan Payment Calculator (Python), and now, a new addition: Bingo Card Generator (Python).

## Repository Details

- **Number of Projects:** 5

## About Me

Hello, I'm Bradley Kars, an avid explorer of technology and coding enthusiast. As a System Support Specialist by profession, I'm constantly seeking ways to enhance my skills and contribute to the dynamic world of IT. With experience managing IT operations for a commercial construction company, I've developed a diverse skill set. Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security with a focus on Game Development, I'm thrilled to merge my coding expertise with insights into cybersecurity.

## The Projects

### Pokedex V1 (Python)
My first iteration of the Pokedex was crafted using Python. I delved into data manipulation and display, creating a simple yet functional version of this iconic digital encyclopedia for Pokemon. Using Python dictionaries, I mapped each Pokemon's name to its properties, including type, stats, and description. Users could input a Pokemon's name, and if it existed in the Pokedex, its properties were displayed.

### Pokedex V2 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Version 2 of my Pokedex took a different route by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focused on web development to create an interactive and visually appealing Pokedex. A web form allowed users to select a Pokemon from a dropdown menu. Upon selection, the webpage dynamically populated with the chosen Pokemon's data, including its number, types, stats, and description. The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided an engaging user experience.

### Prime Number Generator (Python)
This project allows users to specify the number of prime numbers they want to generate. Demonstrating my mathematical and algorithmic skills and showcasing my ability to work on complex mathematical challenges.

### Loan Payment Calculator (Python)
I created a Python script for a loan payment calculator. This tool helps users calculate their loan payments, demonstrating my ability to tackle financial challenges and develop practical applications for everyday use. These utilities expand my programming skills and highlight my versatility in handling diverse projects.

### Bingo Card Generator (Python)
The latest addition to my repository is the Bingo Card Generator, a Python script that generates bingo cards with random numbers. It's a fun and interactive addition to my collection, showcasing my creativity and coding skills.

### Number Distribution Normalization (Python)
This script normalizes the distribution of randomly generated numbers by iteratively adjusting spawn rates. It achieves this by calculating the percentage of occurrence for each number in the generated set and then inverting these percentages. The inverted percentages are used to generate a new set of random numbers, and this process repeats until all numbers have an equal chance of spawning. Through this inversion technique, the script dynamically adjusts the distribution of numbers to achieve normalization.

## Repository Structure

- **Pokedex:** This folder at the root of the repository contains both Pokedex projects:
  - **Pokedex V1 (Python):** Within this subfolder, you'll find the code, resources, and documentation for the Python-based Pokedex V1 project.
  - **Pokedex V2 (HTML & CSS):** Inside this subfolder, you can access the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, along with any relevant assets, for the HTML/CSS-based Pokedex V2 project.

- **Numbers:** The "Numbers" folder contains the following number-related projects:
  - **Prime Number Generator (Python):** This subfolder contains code and documentation for a Python-based prime number generator, customizable for generating prime numbers of your choice.
  - **Number Distribution Normalization (Python):** This script allows for the normalization of number distribution over iterations. It generates random numbers and adjusts their distribution until the likelihood of a number spawning and the total count of each number have both normalized.

- **Calculators:** In the "Calculators" folder, you'll find various calculators I've designed:
  - **Loan Payment Calculator (Python):** This subfolder contains a Python-based loan payment calculator project, demonstrating my financial problem-solving skills and versatile programming capabilities.

- **Generators:** The "Generators" folder is made up of generators I've made for different kinds of projects:
  - **Bingo Card Generator (Python):** Within this section, you'll find the code for my Bingo Card Generator. This project demonstrates my creativity and coding skills, offering a fun and interactive way to generate bingo cards with random numbers.
